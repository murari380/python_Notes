for marks in student_marks:
    total_marks += marks

print("Total Marks:", total_marks)

# Calculate total subjects
total_subjects = len(student_marks)
print("Total Subjects:", total_subjects)

# Calculate average marks
average_marks = total_marks / total_subjects
print("Average Marks:", average_marks)
